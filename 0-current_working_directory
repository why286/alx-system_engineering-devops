Absolutely, here's a script that displays the contents list of the current directory:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script displays the contents list of the current directory.

# Use the 'ls' command to list the contents of the current directory
ls
```

Follow these steps to use the script:

1. Open a text editor.
2. Copy and paste the script into the text editor.
3. Save the file as `1-listit` in the directory where you want to list the contents.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
5. Make the script executable with the command: `chmod +x 1-listit`
6. Run the script with: `./1-listit`

When you run the script, it will display the contents of the current directory, similar to the example you provided.
