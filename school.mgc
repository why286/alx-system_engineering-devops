To create a magic file named `school.mgc` that can be used with the `file` command to detect School data files, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a plain text file named `school.magic` using a text editor:
   
   ```bash
   touch school.magic
   ```

2. Edit the `school.magic` file and add the following line:

   ```
   0 string SCHOOL
   ```

   This line specifies that the string "SCHOOL" should be detected at offset 0 in the file.

3. Compile the `school.magic` file into a binary magic file named `school.mgc` using the `file` command:

   ```bash
   file -C -m school.magic
   ```

   This command compiles the magic file and creates `school.mgc`.

4. Now you can use the `file` command with the `school.mgc` magic file to detect School data files:

   ```bash
   file -m school.mgc your_file
   ```

   Replace `your_file` with the path to the file you want to check.

Remember that the magic file should be placed in a directory that `file` checks for magic files (often `/usr/share/file/magic` or a similar location).
